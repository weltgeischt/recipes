*100 calories per gel, 95 from carbohydrates, 5 calories from fat*

**Differences to commercial gels**

-  doesn't contain *fructose*, which can cause stomach issues (depending
   on dose and your metabolism); Fructose has the advantage of being
   metabolized through a separate pathway, which would allow you to
   absorb more energy if you tolerate it. Note that fructose intolerance
   is relative, meaning that even if you don't have problems with normal
   amounts of fruit, consuming large quantities of fructose (during the
   WCs?) can lead to intestinal distress. If you want fructose, you can
   replace for example half of the dextrose with fructose, or use agave
   syrup to replace a part of the dextrose and water (need to do the
   calculations yourself for that ;) )

-  more *fluid* than regular gel, while having the same calories -
   because it doesn't contain the stuff that causes jellyness in
   commercial gels; for me this makes it way easier to consume and suck
   out of a soft flask

-  as it doesn't contain *preservatives*, it needs to be stored
   cool/frozen. I never experienced it going bad though (I guess as
   sugar is a natural preservative)

**Ingredients**

-  1 1/2 cup **water**

-  2 Â¾ cup **maltodextrin**

-  1 cup **dextrose** *# --> I don't like it that sweet, so I use 0.5
      cups dextrose on 3 cups maltodextrin*

-  1 tbsp rapeseed **oil** *# any kind of neutral oil, if you want a
      Mediterranean flavor, you can, of course, use olive oil ;)*

-  **flavoring**\ \* *# unsweetened, as the gel is already sweet enough!
      also avoid artificial sweeteners*

-  opt: 2 tsp taurine

-  opt: caffeine *#aim for 25 mg of caffeine per gel, you can get it as
      powder or crush pills*

-  opt: pinch of baking soda

-  opt: pinch of pink salt

**Instructions**

1. solid ingredients

   1. put all solid ingredients (**maltodextrin**, **dextrose**, the
         **optionals**) into a bowl and stir together

2. wet ingredients

   1. fill **water** and **oil** into A SEPARATE BOWL/BLENDER

   2. *if you use liquid flavor drops:* add those *# usually they
         contain some kind of alcoholic compound, that helps the
         maltodextrin dissolve*

   3. *else:* add a tiny bit(!) - like a few drops - of booze

3. blend/whisk together the fluid ingredients

4. add scoops of solid ingredients to the wet ingredients one by one,
      blending/whisking in between scoops *# otherwise, especially when
      whisking by hand, the maltodextrin may form clumps that take a
      long time to beat out*

5. blend/whisk until you have a smooth mixture; try how it tastes - you
      can add more flavor if it is too bland

6. opt: if you want it to be it chocolaty/peanutty, you can now add
      peanut butter and or chocolate and blend it

7. Fill into jars (I use ~500 ml) and put in the fridge/freeze

*Keeps ages in the freezer and at least 2 weeks in the fridge*

**\* Further remarks on flavoring**

-  I get flavor drops from a German seller (myAroma), not sure how
   available they are elsewhere; very nice as they contain a bit of
   alcohol to dissolve the maltodextrin and are not sweetened

-  Our all-time favorite is a vanilla-caramel-lemon blend;
   grapefruit-coke is also good

-  Chocolate/peanut butter (using unsweetened cocoa powder and smooth
   peanut butter), can be very nice for cold swimruns; just use a little
   peanut butter not to clog the gel up

-  Mintchoklad (cocoa powder + mint drops) is interesting if you are a
   fan - but don't overdo it with the mint

-  if you have a hard time finding unsweetened flavors

   -  just try adding a bit of lemon juice or aroma stuff you find at
      the baking section

   -  replace a bit of the water with juice (orange?) or green tea???

   -  just do it without flavor!
